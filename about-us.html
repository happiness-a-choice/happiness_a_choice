<div>
With this fast-moving life, our brain with a lot of wishes and expectations is also increasing like anything.
The modern world is surrounded by a heap of imaginary things in which people are losing themselves.
With the help of this happiness app, we wish to remind people that there is a builtin happiness feature inside your body, you only have to turn on the switch. And so we say <div><b>" Happiness A Choice "</b></div>
<br>
<div>In today's world, people are facing many significant issues due to various reasons. Having an uncontrolled mind is yet another issue that is being faced by a lot of people, and it is a thing which is being unnoticed by people.</div>
<br>
<div>It is hard to explain with terminologies, so let's jump straight to examples and simple words.</div>
<br>
<div>People nowadays are stressed by their unwanted job, their unchosen relations, their definition of failure, and the funny part is that they are also stressed by their wanted job, their chosen relationships, and their definition of success.</div>
<br>
<div>We have learned this thing since born. When we used to fall to the ground, we were taught to slap the ground instead of dealing with the wound and the pain.
We all may know that when we see, hear, smell, touch, and taste, you experience it inside our body and not outside. Then why do we try to change the outer situations when something doesn't happen right.</div>
<br>
<div>Well, outside situations are something that we cannot control 100% according to us, but we can control ourselves at least.
If something in the outside world is not happening right, if some situation is causing you to stress then you should first know that you yourself are taking that stress and letting it harm your body, no other person is giving you "stress medicine" to eat, you yourself are taking those medicines.
So you have a choice, you always have.</div>
<br>
<div>Let me explain this point with a quick example.</div>
<br>
<div>Suppose you are in 12th, today is your first board exam, too much pressure right.
Then suddenly your friend comes to you to whom you had proposed a few days ago, and he/she accepts it.
Now two situations can happen at this time.
</div>
<br>
<div><b>1.</b> You are so overwhelmed by what is happening, and you forgot all your exam stress, and now you are in the 7th cloud.</div>
<div><b>2.</b> Another situation can be that you are so stressed with your exam that you completely ignored what your friend just said and you might tell them to please talk after exams.</div>
<br>
<div>
The first one seems to be the most obvious case in today's generation.
Now, if you think that you experience such things due to outside conditions, then it should have been the same for all.
Of course, it happens due to external conditions but not because of what is happening outside but because of how you perceive it. This makes the difference individually.
Many of you might already be aware of these things but still not acting over it. Or might not know how to.</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
<b>" W</b>e, through this app, want to deliver some opinions, some perceptions, and a few ways to improve your well-being.
Why are we saying opinions and perceptions? Because this is just our way of looking at life. <b>"</b></div></span>
